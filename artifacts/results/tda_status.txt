2010 Point Omega (Delillo, Don [Delillo, Don]) (Z-Library)_embeddings.npz	ANALYZE_OK|VIS_ERR:Visualize requires a mapper with more than 0 nodes. 
It is possible that the constructed mapper could have been constructed with bad parameters. This can occasionally happens when using the default clustering algorithm. Try changing `eps` or `min_samples` in the DBSCAN clustering algorithm.
